# Update of Selig 2014

- Original study
    - IUCN, BLI, AM data for spp dists (~12000ish spp total) to calculate for each cell:
        - Species richness
        - Range rarity
        - Relative range rarity
    - compare to CHI overall map - 
        - high impact (high threat - vocab here? can we frame it as a verb?  as 
          potential for degradation etc?)
        - low impact  (low threat)
    - at coarse scale (hexagons at 2200 km^2?)
- New study
    - Add more species with updated data sets
        - possibly "core habitat"? i.e. 60% AM abnd IUCN AOO maps?
        - Same metrics - richness, range rarity, rel range rarity
        - can we add some metric of functional group representation?
    - Add IUCN extinction risk
        - mean(risk), var(risk) across all spp - to identify impacted/degraded areas
        - threatened/endangered spp count and relative endangered spp count - 
          another measure of conservation priority
    - Analyze newest CHI overall impact - analyze at finer scale e.g. 1 km^2?
    - Add in the rate of change as additional filter - bad and getting worse; 
      pristine but getting worse.
    - Can we incorporate acceleration into this as well? e.g. stabilizing?  or 
      highly variable impacts?
- SI
    - break into taxonomic groups
    - separate analysis by range sizes (endemism?)
    - analyze by stressor clusters
