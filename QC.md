QUALITY CHECK: 

Fishing effort - when normalizing to intensity, set NAs to zero to make sure they don't artificially create NAs?

for trend calcs, figure out which changes in status are based on actual change - where is this info? - and then just use those to calc trends.

check maps:
* indiv maps that have problems when cropping; identify the specific spp, how to fix?
* check spp from terrestrial mammals, birds, and reptiles to make sure we're not bringing in a lot of terrestrial spp

Figure out which taxa to include in the main taxa maps: important, interesting, and look good small

include AquaMaps for any last spp?  see how many we get from Gina - and see how many are left that overlap with AquaMaps.


Habitat-forming species health vs. habitat-inhabiting spp health regression?  This is a SI analysis.
