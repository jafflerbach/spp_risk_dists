QUALITY CHECK: 

Fishing effort - when normalizing to intensity, set NAs to zero to make sure they don't artificially create NAs?

for trend calcs, figure out which changes in status are based on actual change - where is this info? - and then just use those to calc trends.

check spp lists: 
* e.g. 172151 is a plant that maybe shouldn't be in there?  (but do we have a map anyway, if it's terrestrial)
* reptiles and birds are the biggest worry since these cross terrestrial AND marine realms
* what about polar bears?

Figure out which taxa to include in the main taxa maps: important, interesting, and look good small

include AquaMaps for any last spp?  see how many we get from Gina - and see how many are left that overlap with AquaMaps.

figure out MEOW to IUCN regional assessment lookup

Habitat-forming species health vs. habitat-inhabiting spp health regression?  This is a SI analysis.
